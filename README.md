DEEP LEARNING ON PUBLIC DATASET TEMPLATE
Inspired by the timeless wisdom of Hippocrates, whose words "prevention is better than cure" continue to resonate, I set out to create a predictive model that could detect diseases in
their earliest stages, offering hope for more accurate and timely interventions. The project, aptly named "Symptom Master," seeks to provide an innovative solution to the age-old challenge 
of diagnosing diseases based on symptoms. Recognizing the limitations of traditional diagnostic methods and the potential of AI to fill this gap, "Symptom Master" aims to empower both medical
professionals and individuals alike with a tool that can streamline 
the diagnostic process and improve healthcare outcomes
